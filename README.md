<p><strong>Introduction to npm (Node Package Manager)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong>  
In this course, I explored npm (Node Package Manager), a command-line tool that simplifies the installation, creation, and sharing of JavaScript packages specifically designed for Node.js. npm provides access to a vast repository of open-source packages, allowing developers to leverage existing solutions for common tasks such as date manipulation or API data fetching. Understanding how to navigate npm effectively helps avoid duplicating efforts and accelerates development.</p>
