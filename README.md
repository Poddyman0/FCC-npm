<p><strong>Introduction to npm (Node Package Manager)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong>  
In this course, I explored npm (Node Package Manager), a command-line tool that simplifies the installation, creation, and sharing of JavaScript packages specifically designed for Node.js. npm provides access to a vast repository of open-source packages, allowing developers to leverage existing solutions for common tasks such as date manipulation or API data fetching. Understanding how to navigate npm effectively helps avoid duplicating efforts and accelerates development.</p>

<p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>npm:</strong> Command-line tool for managing JavaScript packages, including installation, creation, and sharing of packages.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Features Implemented:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Package Management:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Learned to use npm for installing and managing JavaScript libraries and tools.</li>
      <li>Explored the npm repository to find and use existing packages that address common development needs.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Understanding package.json:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Gained insight into the package.json file, which holds metadata about the project, including its dependencies, scripts, and configuration.</li>
      <li>Managed dependencies by adding, updating, and removing packages using npm commands.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Dependency Management:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Handled different types of dependencies (e.g., dependencies and devDependencies) to ensure the project has the right libraries for both production and development environments.</li>
      <li>Used npm scripts to automate common tasks such as testing and building the project.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
